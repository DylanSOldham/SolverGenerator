# PDE Solver Generator

I wrote this tool to help with my capstone project at Oregon State University.

You can describe systems of partial differential equations using a simple syntax. This description is then translated into C++ code
which compiles into an executable which solves that system using CVODES.

More information, including build and usage instructions, can be found in the docs folder.
